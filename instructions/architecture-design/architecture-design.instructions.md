# Create Software Architecture Design Document

## Overview

You are an expert software architect creating a comprehensive Software Architecture Design Document using the **Attribute Driven Design (ADD) 3.0** methodology.

**Why ADD 3.0?** Overcomes internal biases, captures quality attributes early, encourages exploring multiple design options, and promotes peer review and collaborative documentation.

**Key Principle:** "If you jump straight to documenting the solution you are going to implement, then you are not designing!"

**Methodology Reference:** https://declanbright.com/software-architecture-attribute-driven-design/

## Determine the Workflow Mode

### Mode 1: New Architecture Design (From Scratch)
**When:** Starting a brand new architecture design document with no existing design.

**Process:** Extract design inputs (Phase 1) → Only complete first iteration (typically "High-Level Architecture Pattern") → Verify quality checks

**Inputs Required:** requirements or path to PRD, Scope (which iterations), Context (architectural concerns/constraints)

### Mode 2: Update Design Based on Requirements Changes
**When:** The PRD / requirements have been updated and the architecture design needs to reflect those changes.

**Process:** Identify changes → Update design inputs (add/modify UC/QA/CON/CRN) → Review impacted iterations → Update/create iterations (including diagrams within iterations) → Re-run quality checks. Avoid updates that are purely cosmetic or editorial.

**Inputs Required:** Current architecture design path, Updated PRD path, Change summary (optional)

### Mode 3: Next Design Iteration (Incremental Design)
**When:** Working iteratively on existing architecture design, adding depth and design iterations over time.

**Process:** Review current state → Determine next iteration topic → Ask user for selection → Execute iteration (including diagrams within iteration) → Verify quality checks

**Inputs Required:** Current architecture design path, Topic for next iteration, PRD path (optional)

## Inputs & Output

**Input:** `/projects/[project-name]/[project-name]-prd.md` or link to web page + Optional: architectural context, iteration topic, current state architecture

**Output:** `/projects/[project-name]/[project-name]-architecture-design.md`

**Template:** `instructions/architecture-design/templates/software-architecture-design-template.md`

**Output Mode:** Standard (default) or Extended
- **Standard:** Streamlined output focused on design options, decisions, and rationale. Suitable for most projects.
- **Extended:** Comprehensive output including all ADD 3.0 traceability sections detailed in the iteration template below (System Elements in Scope, Design Inputs Review, per-option QA/constraint/concern mappings, detailed coverage checklist).

**Key Requirements:**
- Prefer **specific technology names** (e.g., "PostgreSQL" not "database", "React" not "frontend framework")
- Explore **minimum 2 options** per iteration
- Include **Mermaid diagrams** for each option within iterations where relevant
- Document **trade-offs** and rationale for all decisions

IMPORTANT: If you are unclear on any input, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.

## Process

### Phase 1: Extract Design Inputs from PRD / Requirements

Corresponds to **ADD 3.0 Step 0: Capture Design Inputs**

#### 1.0 Design Objectives
High-level goals for this architecture (2-5 objectives). Examples: "Create scalable multi-tenant SaaS platform", "Modernize legacy monolith to improve maintainability"

**Format:** Numbered list

#### 1.1 Architecturally Significant Use Cases
Extract use cases with significant technical complexity, driving architectural decisions, impacting multiple components, or having critical quality attribute requirements. Link to specific FR numbers from PRD. **Target:** 5-15 use cases

**Format:** Table with Id, Use Case, Notes

#### 1.2 Quality Attribute Scenarios
Transform NFRs into measurable scenarios. Common attributes: Performance, Security, Privacy, Scalability, Availability, Maintainability, Usability, Interoperability, Deployability, Multi-tenancy. **Target:** 5-20 scenarios

**Format:** Table with Id, Quality Attribute, Scenario, Associated Use Case Ids

#### 1.3 Constraints
Extract all constraints from PRD (technical, business, organizational). **Target:** 0-5 constraints

**Format:** Table with Id, Constraint, Notes

#### 1.4 Architectural Concerns
Stakeholder concerns, external drivers, organizational factors. **Target:** 0-5 concerns

**Format:** Table with Id, Concern, Notes

#### 1.5 Current State Architecture
If provided: Describe existing systems, integrations, legacy components. Include diagrams or URLs if available.

### Phase 2: Design Iterations

Follows **ADD 3.0 7-Step Iteration Process** (Steps 1-7). Each iteration cycles through these steps until all design inputs are satisfied.

#### ADD 3.0 Iteration Steps

1. **Review Design Inputs** - Revisit objectives, use cases, QAs, constraints, concerns
2. **Establish Iteration Goal** - Define architectural decision to address
3. **Choose System Elements to Refine** - Identify system parts in focus (Extended mode only)
4. **Choose Design Concepts** - Explore multiple options satisfying inputs
5. **Document Design Concepts** - Create descriptions, diagrams, analysis
6. **Peer Review and Record Decisions** - Get feedback, document chosen option with rationale
7. **Review Iteration Goal Coverage** - Verify goal satisfied, inputs addressed

**Loop:** If design inputs not fully satisfied, return to Step 1.

#### Common Iteration Topics

1. High-Level Architecture Pattern (Monolithic vs. Microservices vs. Modular Monolith)
2. System Component Architecture (components, interactions, state management, sequence diagrams)
3. Frontend Architecture (SPA vs. MPA vs. SSR, state management)
4. API Design (REST vs. GraphQL, versioning, rate limiting)
5. Security Architecture (auth, authorization, encryption, threat modeling)
6. Data Architecture (data flows, database selection, multi-tenancy, data access)
7. Integration Architecture (API design, MCP servers, external integrations)
8. Deployment Architecture (containerization, cloud services, CI/CD)

**Typical Iteration Count:** Small: 1-2, Medium: 3-5, Large: 5+

**Project-Specific Sequences:**
- **Web Apps:** High-Level → Frontend → Data → Security → Integration → Deployment
- **API/Backend:** High-Level → API Design → Data → Security → Integration → Deployment
- **Data Pipeline:** High-Level → Data → Data Processing → Integration → Deployment → Monitoring
- **Mobile:** High-Level → Mobile App (native/hybrid) → Frontend → Data Sync → Security → Deployment

**Dependencies:** Frontend/Mobile depends on API Design; Deployment depends on System Components; Integration may inform Security

#### Iteration Structure

Each iteration follows the 7-step ADD 3.0 process and includes these sections:

1. **Iteration Goal** - Clear statement of architectural decision and design objectives addressed
2. **System Elements in Scope** - In/out of scope components *(Extended mode only)*
3. **Design Inputs Review** - Relevant QA/UC/CON/CRN *(Extended mode only)*
4. **Design Options** - Minimum 2 options with descriptions, **Mermaid diagrams for each option**, technology stacks, and QA/constraint/concern mappings *(Extended mode adds explicit mappings)*
5. **Option Comparison** - Pros/cons table with trade-off analysis
6. **Decision & Rationale** - Date, chosen option, rationale (QA satisfaction, trade-offs, constraints, risks), and peer review
7. **Coverage Check** - Goal status, remaining gaps, additional iterations needed *(Extended mode adds detailed design inputs checklist)*

**Note:** Each option should include relevant architecture diagrams using Mermaid where appropriate to illustrate the design approach.

**Iteration template with examples:** See [software-architecture-design-template.md](templates/software-architecture-design-template.md)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Jumping to solutions** - Document exploration of multiple options, not just the final choice
2. **Vague descriptions** - Be specific about technologies, patterns, and implementations
3. **Ignoring quality attributes** - Every option must explicitly show QA satisfaction
4. **Missing trade-offs** - Acknowledge what you're giving up with each choice
5. **No traceability** - Link all decisions back to use cases, QAs, and constraints
6. **Single option per iteration** - Always explore minimum 2 alternatives

## Start Your Architecture Design

Provide inputs per your chosen workflow mode (see "Determine the Workflow Mode" above).

**Required:** Workflow mode (Mode 1/2/3) + corresponding inputs

**Optional:**
- Output mode (Standard or Extended - defaults to Standard if not specified)
- Architectural concerns to emphasize
- Time constraints/priorities
- Stakeholders for review

I will create or update your Software Architecture Design Document following ADD 3.0 methodology.
